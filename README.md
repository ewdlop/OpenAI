To implement the **Heart Space** model using **Coq**, a formal proof assistant, we can encode the concepts of **心力 (Heart Effort)**, **業力 (Karma/Energetic Momentum)**, and their relationship as defined by **Backward's Law**. Coq can help us construct a logical framework that models these ideas mathematically and allows for verification of properties about the Heart Space.

### **1. Structure of the Coq Representation**
We'll define:
1. **Types and Parameters:**
   - Represent **心力** and **業力** as parameters or variables in the system.
2. **Heart Space Formula:**
   - Implement the Heart Space energy formula:
     \[
     \text{Heart Space Energy (HSE)} = \alpha (\text{Effort} \cdot \text{Alignment}) - \beta (\text{Resistance} \cdot \text{Karmic Load})
     \]
3. **Backward's Law:**
   - Model Backward's Law as a property or invariant ensuring that over-effort or resistance contracts the Heart Space.
4. **Proofs:**
   - Verify properties such as balance or expansion under given conditions.

### **2. Coq Implementation**

Here's how we might encode this in Coq:

#### **A. Define Basic Types and Parameters**
```coq
(* Define types for effort and karma *)
Parameter Effort : Type.
Parameter Karma : Type.

(* Define numeric types for calculations *)
Parameter Alignment : R. (* Alignment as a real number *)
Parameter Resistance : R. (* Resistance as a real number *)
Parameter KarmicLoad : R. (* Karmic load as a real number *)

(* Define coefficients *)
Parameter alpha beta : R. (* Alpha and Beta coefficients *)

(* Define operations for effort and karma *)
Parameter effort_level : Effort -> R.
Parameter karma_momentum : Karma -> R.
```

---

#### **B. Define Heart Space Energy (HSE)**
```coq
(* Define Heart Space Energy formula *)
Definition HSE (e : Effort) (k : Karma) : R :=
  alpha * (effort_level e * Alignment) - beta * (Resistance * KarmicLoad).
```

---

#### **C. Define Backward's Law Properties**
```coq
(* Backward's Law: Excess effort or resistance reduces Heart Space Energy *)
Theorem backward_law :
  forall e k : Effort * Karma,
  (effort_level (fst e) > 1 \/ Resistance > 1) ->
  HSE (fst e) (snd e) < HSE (fst e) (snd e).
Proof.
  intros e k H.
  destruct H as [Effort_Over | Resistance_Over].
  - (* Case: Over-effort *)
    unfold HSE. (* Expand the definition of HSE *)
    (* Prove that excessive effort leads to reduction in HSE *)
    admit. (* Detailed proof to be filled *)
  - (* Case: High resistance *)
    unfold HSE.
    (* Prove that excessive resistance leads to reduction in HSE *)
    admit.
Admitted.
```

---

#### **D. Verify Properties of Heart Space Expansion**
```coq
(* When effort and karma are balanced, HSE increases *)
Theorem balance_hse_expansion :
  forall e k : Effort * Karma,
  effort_level (fst e) <= 1 /\ Resistance <= 1 ->
  HSE (fst e) (snd e) > 0.
Proof.
  intros e k H.
  destruct H as [Effort_Balanced Resistance_Balanced].
  unfold HSE.
  (* Show that balanced parameters lead to positive HSE *)
  admit. (* Fill in proof steps *)
Admitted.
```

### **3. Extending the Model**
- **Probabilistic Dynamics:**
  - Add stochastic elements to model real-world variability in **業力** and **心力**.
- **Iterative Processes:**
  - Use Coq's inductive structures to simulate iterative changes in Heart Space energy over time.

---

### **4. Next Steps**
- Formalize assumptions about **Alignment** and **KarmicLoad** as dependent functions of **Effort** and **Karma**.
- Use Coq to prove that minimizing resistance and balanced effort maximizes the Heart Space energy.

Would you like further elaboration on any of these elements or additional features for the Coq model?
